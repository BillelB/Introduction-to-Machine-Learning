# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

This little paper introduces main machine learning algorithms with illustrations and some proofs.
You will find supervised and unsupervised learning. In the supervised section I discuss regression and classification using
famous algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM etc... And the last part deals with unsupervised methods like K-Means, DBSCAN etc... You will find along with this article a jupyter notebook that has been used to draw the graphs.
